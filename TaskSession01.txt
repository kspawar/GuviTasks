*******   Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2   **********

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. 
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 
HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer 
and a local or remote web server.
In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. 
In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.

HTTP1.1 : 
1. 	HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form.
2. 	Head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests 
	until the response does not receive. all the information related to the header 
	file is repeated in every request.
3.	It uses resource inlining , if client needs a specific file to render a page then inlining
	that file will reduced the number of request by the client.
4.	It compresses data by itself.
	
	
HTTP2 : 
1. 	HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages 
	in binary format.
2.	It works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests.
3.	The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using 
	the PUSH frame.
4.	HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. it compresses the header.

********  Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript  *********

Objects are important data types in javascript. 
Objects are not primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, 
in the context of an object.

Every object has some property associated with some value. 
These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

let stud = new Student();
stud.name = 'Arun';
stud.rollno = 35;
stud.dept = 'Computer';

After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

stud.name
Output : Arun

Unassigned properties of an object are undefined.

The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;


The syntax to access a property from an object is:
objectName.property        
           
objectName["property”]     
           
objectName[expression]  

An object method is an object property containing a function definition.
function(){ console.log("Writing") }

Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal :-
let stud = {name: 'Arun', rollno: 35, dept: 'Computer'};

Create JavaScript Object with Constructor :-
Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword.

function Student(name, rollno){
	this.name = name;
	this.rollno = rollno;
}

let stud = new Student('Arun', 35);
let stud = new Student('Ajay', 45);

Using the JavaScript Keyword new :-
It is similar to above example.
let stud = new Student();
stud.name  = 'Arun';
stud.rollno = 45;

Using the Object.create method :-
Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. 
This method can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the 
prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function.

var Student = {
	College : 'MU College';
	displayclg: function(){
					console.log(this.College);
				};
};

let arun = Object.create(Student);
arun.displayclg();
Output : MU College

let ajay = Object.create(Student);
ajay.College = 'MAH College';
ajay.displayclg();
MAH College

Window Object:

Window object represents the browser's window or potentially frame, that 
a document is displayed in.
It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy.

Document Object:

When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.
The document object is the root node of the HTML document.
The document object is a property of the window object.
The document object is accessed with:
window.document or just document


The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document 
object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

We can access a document object either using window.document property or using document 
object directly as window is global object.

The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties 
and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior. 
In the below example window.open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() 
creates a blank document within the window.
